## üõ† SQL Code ‚Äì Accounting Reports

This project is based on a **denormalized dataset**, so most of the work in SQL involved creating **views** to be used in **Power BI**.  
The only custom logic implemented in SQL was the `DimCalendar` procedure.

## üë©‚Äçüíª SQL Views

Below are the views created to organize and expose the data for reporting:
 
CREATE VIEW vwDimAccount AS 
SELECT 
    AccountKey,
    ParentAccountKey,
    AccountCodeAlternateKey,
    ParentAccountCodeAlternateKey,
    AccountDescription,
    AccountType,
    Operator,
    ValueType
FROM DimAccount
WHERE LEFT(AccountCodeAlternateKey, 1) <> 9;


CREATE VIEW vwDimCalendar AS 
SELECT *
FROM dcalendar;


CREATE VIEW vwDimOrganization AS 
SELECT  
    OrganizationKey,
    ParentOrganizationKey,
    OrganizationName
FROM DimOrganization
WHERE ParentOrganizationKey IS NOT NULL;

CREATE VIEW vwDimScenario AS
SELECT * 
FROM DimScenario;

CREATE VIEW vwFactFinance AS 
SELECT *
FROM FactFinance;
