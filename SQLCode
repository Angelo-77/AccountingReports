## üõ† SQL Code - Accounting Reports
üõ† SQL Code ‚Äì Accounting Reports
Since our dataset was denormalized, I only created views to use in Power BI. In this project, we didn‚Äôt do much SQL work except for the DimCalendar procedure.

You can see the DimCalendar procedure by clicking [here](https://github.com/Angelo-77/AccountingReports/blob/ef7db519229df11037af6ebf2995a27759a03058/DimCalendar)
